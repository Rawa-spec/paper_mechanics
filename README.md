Welcome to my paper mechanics website!

This website features a service for a class that teaches origami. It is for all ages.

Testing and bugs:
I had trouble showing a background image embedded in the body element inall the webpages. The issue has not been resolved. When insued the the W3C CSS validator it pointed out that there is no code to link the html documents to the CSS stylesheet. Then, the issue was resolved.

I have tested the screen layout of the website, on the 'am i responsive' website.( https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://8000-rawaspec-papermechanics-mxmavcfxlkk.ws-eu81.gitpod.io/home.html )

Credits:
I have found the imgaes on google images.
