### Encountered Bugs (Fixed/Resolved)
I had trouble showing a background image embedded in the body element inall the webpages. The issue has not been resolved. When insued the the W3C CSS validator it pointed out that there is no code to link the html documents to the CSS stylesheet. Then, the issue was resolved.

## Deployment procedure
The application is deployed by configuring the github repository to use the main branch for a github pages site. Each commit to the main branch will update the site url.
